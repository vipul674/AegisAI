Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Compliance Scheduler** — Implemented background APScheduler jobs (`snapshot_compliance_scores`, `send_reassessment_reminders`) for daily compliance snapshots and risk-assessment expiry notifications.
- **Pre-commit hooks** — Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with repository hygiene hooks (trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-merge-conflict, check-yaml, check-json) and a local ESLint hook wrapping the existing frontend lint command.
- **LLM Guard Prompt Normalization** — Preprocessor layer (`normalizer.py`) to prevent Unicode, zero-width, and homoglyph bypasses:
  - Strips invisible format characters in Unicode `Cf` category (e.g. zero-width space, non-joiner, joiner)
  - Normalizes stylized font variations using NFKC compatibility normalization
  - Resolves Cyrillic and Greek homoglyphs to standard Latin equivalents via static mapping
  - Retains both `normalized_prompt` and `user_prompt` in orchestrator response
- Unit and integration tests for bypass payloads (`test_normalizer.py` and `test_guard.py`)

### Fixed
- **Analytics Dashboard (#921)** — Replaced hardcoded mock data with live API calls (`/analytics/summary`, `/analytics/compliance-timeline`, `/analytics/system-risk`). Added loading skeletons, error states with retry buttons, system selector dropdown, and dynamic dark/light chart theming.
- **RAG Plaintext Privacy (#1034)** — Replaced plaintext question/answer storage with SHA-256 hashes in `RagQuery` and `RAGFeedback` models; history endpoint returns hashes and lengths instead of raw text, preventing accidental plaintext exposure in the database and API responses.
- **Webhook Delivery (#1033)** — Changed webhook delivery from `BackgroundTasks` to direct synchronous `_post_webhook` call with retry logic, ensuring immediate delivery during request lifecycle.
- **Per-user FAISS Isolation (#920)** — Added `FAISS_INDEX_BASE_PATH` config and `_get_index_path(user_id)` helper. Vector store functions now accept a `user_id` parameter to store/load indexes under `{FAISS_INDEX_BASE_PATH}/user_{user_id}/`, preventing cross-user data leakage in RAG queries.
- **Frontend Theme** — Fixed dark mode flash of unstyled content (FOUC), eliminated duplicate CSS, fixed React state overwrite bugs, and improved system preference synchronization.
- **Documents API** — Validate `ai_system_id` ownership before creating documents so users cannot link documents to another user's AI system.
- **PDF Export** — Escape user-controlled document text before ReportLab rendering and sanitize generated download filenames.
- **SSRF Prevention** — Added URL validation to webhook endpoints to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks:
  - Blocks private, link-local, loopback, reserved, and multicast IP addresses
  - Blocks cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254)
  - Blocks internal hostnames (localhost, *.internal, *.local)
  - Only allows http and https schemes
  - Validation applied both at webhook creation time (Pydantic schema) and delivery time (background task)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Compliance Engine** — EU AI Act risk classification (Minimal / Limited / High / Unacceptable)
- AI system registry with CRUD endpoints
- Compliance document generation (Technical Documentation, Risk Assessment, Conformity Declaration)
- JWT authentication (register, login, `/me`)
- **LLM Guard module** — 4-layer prompt injection defence:
  - Regex heuristic filter
  - DeBERTa-v3 intent classifier (benign / suspicious / malicious)
  - Decision engine (allow / sanitize / block)
  - Prompt sanitizer (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH levels)
- `POST /api/v1/guard/scan` endpoint
- **RAG Intelligence module** — FAISS vector store + LangChain 0.2 retrieval chain
- `POST /api/v1/rag/query` endpoint
- Provider-agnostic LLM client (OpenAI-compatible: works with Ollama, Groq, Together AI, vLLM …)
- React 18 + TypeScript frontend (Dashboard, AI Systems, Classification, Documents)
- Docker Compose setup
- Kubernetes deployment & HPA configs
- Colab-ready notebook for fine-tuning the Guard classifier

### Known Limitations (good first contributions!)
- RAG knowledge base is empty by default — needs regulatory documents ingested
- No audit log for Guard decisions yet
- Stripe billing wired up but not activated
- Frontend pages for Guard and RAG not yet built

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Notifications API**

- Added `GET /api/v1/notifications/unread-count` endpoint to retrieve the current user's unread notification count.
- Added `POST /api/v1/notifications/read-all` endpoint to mark all unread notifications as read.
- Added `DELETE /api/v1/notifications/read` endpoint to delete all read notifications for the current user.
- Added unit tests covering unread count retrieval, mark-all-read functionality, and bulk deletion of read notifications while preserving notification ownership boundaries.
